      <h2>History</h2>
      <h3>How we met</h3>
      <p>"Well it was in 2012 I was form two ,it was at a rural camp and I just
      took one look and I got confused ,you made it worse I was washing dishes
      after church and you kept talking ..the following day was the last day
      you were wearing a purple shirt" - Perpetual</p><hr>

      <h3>Most important historical events</h3>
      <p>My turning point is when a close relative of my got sick ,she was 27 it
      was when I knew life could just end just ,its when I realized that as
      much as l like what I was doing I wanted more from from life .it is then
      that I realized she was 27 but she was still trying to get where she
      wants but was taking the long way ....I went to take her results e upper
      six when she had passed and when people were shared her things I took
      her passport which was not even a year old ,I had also a note that she
      had wrote to her boyfriend that she loves him and would spend the rest
      of her life with him it was in French ðŸ˜‚ it was a painful time for me
      I leant to appreciate jus being in the sun because I visited her and I
      couldn't take her out ,nurses thot she was my sister we looked so alike,
      she was a fighter and when her fight ended I thot she was going to wake
      up ,she had the purest heart so blameless and Everytime she was always
      smiling.</p>
      <p>I leant that there are things I can't control,I cried once at her
      funeral when I realized she wasn't going to wake up,I don't want to
      leave Zimbabwe before I can make 27 years an age for people who have
      finished school and earning money ,I don't want to leave Zimbabwe
      before I make it possible for people not rely on certain level of
      sxul to do archive and also sxul then job to finance project isn't
      the only way to make it.</p>
